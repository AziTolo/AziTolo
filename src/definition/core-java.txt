What is OOP? Define each OOP concept.
Answer:Object Oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects. It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints , which are used to create individual instances of objects. Abstraction: means using simple things to represent complexity,In Java, abstraction means simple things like objects, classes, and variables represent more complex underlying code and data.Encapsulation:is used to hide the values or state of a structured data object inside a class , preventing unauthorized parties' direct access to them.Inheritance :is a feature that helps to reuse the methods and variables of one class in another class,it allows a new class to inherit the properties and functions of an existing class without rewriting the code.Polymorphism:Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance This allows us to perform a single action in different ways.

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?

What is static keyword? When and how do we use it?

The main method of a class is generally labeled static.Use a static class to contain methods that are not associated with a particular object,

What is final keyword? When and how do we use it?
Answer:The final keyword is a non-access modifier used for classes, attributes and methods, which makes them non-changeable.The final keyword is useful when you want a variable to always store the same value,we can declare some or all of a class's methods final. You use the final keyword in a method declaration to indicate that the method cannot be overridden by subclasses

Explain the difference between final, finally and finalize?
Answer:The final is a keyword in Java that prevents changing variables, avoid method overriding and avoid extending classes.The finally is a block in Java exception handling, that will execute whether an exception is thrown or not.The finalize is a method in Java, called by the garbage collector before it destroys the object completely.The final is applicable for variables, methods and classes.The finally is applicable with a try and catch blocks.The finalize is applicable for objects.

What is a constructor?
Answer:A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects. The constructor is called when an object of a class is created. It can be used to set initial values for object attributes
